A detailed manual explaining the way to run the programme is under development and will be included in this repository soon. Nevertheless, the example files are self-explanatory and it shouldnâ€™t be too difficult to construct your own files following the instruction inside. Additionally, some information can be obtained from the article presenting the development (10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742370).
By now, only the Windows version (64-bits) R_P_M_win.exe is available. Put in into your PC and you can directly run it by double-clicking on it. Remember to put the input files in the same folder as the executable. Compulsory files are *_param, *_genot and anneal_param.txt. Linux and Mac executables are on their way. 
You can contact me at jmj@inia.csic.es to ask for any help in the execution of the software.
